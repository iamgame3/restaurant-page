# Restaurant Page Project (WIP)

This project is meant to test my ablity to effectively use Webpack, JS modules, and show advanced control over the DOM.

Pretty intuitive, just click the tabs at the top of the page to switch between various menu sections.

P.S. This project is a part of The Odin Project's course.
