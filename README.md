# Restaurant Page Project

This project is meant to test my ablity to effectively use Webpack, JS modules, and show advanced control over the DOM.

You only need to download the files in the src directory for the webpage to work. The page itself is pretty intuitive, just click the tabs at the top of the page to switch between various menu sections.

P.S. This project is a part of The Odin Project's course.
